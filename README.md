The relevant coding of the experimental part in the paper.
File “Feature Selection” contains programs for preprocessing data and experiments with the random forest model to select key variables. Due to the large size of the IPCC dataset used in the experiment, we have not uploaded it here.
File"SpaCVAE"contains programs for training a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based on Pytorch. We saved the model parameters and synthetic ensembles.
File"Sobol Decomposition" contains experiments for conducting Sobol decomposition on both AR6 and synthetic databases.
File"SHAP Analysis" contains the interpretation of influential features using shapley values.
